# Clipboard Management

Vicinae fully integrates with your system clipboard and includes a powerful clipboard history module. In practice, this makes Vicinae a capable standalone clipboard manager as well. This document explains how it works and outlines its key features. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Environment Support

Clipboard behavior can vary significantly depending on the desktop environment or compositor in use. Below is a table showing which environments Vicinae currently supports.

If you’d like to contribute support for an environment that isn’t yet compatible, please [read this guide](/contrib/clipboard).

| Name | Supported | Comment |
|------|-----------|---------|
| X11 | ❌ | Planned for future implementation |
| KDE Wayland | ✅ | Uses the `wlr-data-control` protocol |
| Gnome | ✅ | Using the <a href="https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension" target="_blank">Vicinae Gnome Extension</a> (See installation [on Gnome Support](/gnome-support)) |
| Hyprland | ✅ | |
| Sway | ✅ | |
| Niri | ✅ | |
| Other Wayland compositors | - | Works if the compositor implements `wlr-data-control` (most do) |

## Introduction

When launched, Vicinae starts a clipboard server that monitors clipboard activity in the current environment.

You can quickly check whether clipboard management is active by opening the clipboard history command.

If the option shows `Pause clipboard` or `Resume clipboard`, it means a working clipboard server is currently tracking clipboard activity.  
If it displays an error instead, your environment may not be supported, or another issue may have occurred. The logs can help you pinpoint the cause.

## Understanding Clipboard Selections

When an application copies something to the clipboard, it creates a **clipboard selection**. This selection contains a set of MIME types—often called *data offers*—that represent the various formats in which the content can be provided. This allows the receiving application to choose the most suitable format.

For example, copying the URL `https://docs.vicinae.com` from a Chromium browser results in the following:

``` {{ title: 'wl-paste -l' }}
STRING  
UTF8_STRING  
text/plain  
text/plain;charset=utf-8  
text/plain;charset=utf-8  
TEXT
```

The clipboard server integrated with Vicinae notifies the clipboard service whenever a new selection appears. The service then indexes the content and adds a new entry to the clipboard history.

<Note> Every data offer is stored and indexed. For example, copying an image from a browser may store both the image and its full-text URL—allowing you to search for it later via its URL. </Note>

## Tagging Selections

The clipboard history module allows you to tag selections with custom keywords.
Simply activate the Edit keywords action on any selection and enter the desired keywords. These tags make it easier to locate a selection later through search.

## Security

By default, Vicinae reads and stores all data offers from each unique selection on disk, fully encrypted with AES256-GCM.
Text-only content is also stored in a full-text search SQLite index to enable content-based search.

However, because the SQLite database is not yet encrypted (this feature is planned), some clipboard history data may remain unencrypted.
