# GNOME Quickstart

This guide explains how to quickly get started with Vicinae on GNOME.

## Install the Vicinae Gnome Extension (Recommended but not required)

The <a href="https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension" target="_blank">Vicinae Gnome Extension</a> is a companion extension for GNOME that provides the following features:

- Expose **clipboard** events and **window management** APIs through D-Bus
- Blocking specific applications from accessing the clipboard (like password managers)
- Imitate the layer shell protocol to create a detached floating launcher window which closes on focus loss
- Paste clipboard entry to the active window

### Extension Installation

1. Download the `.shell-extension.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension/releases/latest)
2. Install using: `gnome-extensions install --force <filename>`
3. Enable the extension in GNOME Extensions app
4. Restart GNOME Shell or log out/in

## Feedback HUD and GNOME

Since the feedback HUD (Vicinae Notifications) is a normal floating window, it will grab focus when it appears. To disable this, run vicinae server with the `VICINAE_DISABLE_HUD` environment variable set to 1.

- If you are using systemd, you can add `Environment=VICINAE_DISABLE_HUD=1` to the `vicinae.service` file to disable it automatically when the server starts.

- If you are using the startup applications feature, you can also disable it by editing the `.desktop` file and changing the `Exec` key to `VICINAE_DISABLE_HUD=1 vicinae server`.

## Start the Vicinae server

### Systemd

On GNOME, the best way to launch the Vicinae server is to enable the systemd user service:

```bash
systemctl --user enable vicinae --now
```

This will start the Vicinae server immediately and make sure it is started when a new GNOME session is started.

To view the server logs:

```bash
journalctl --user -u vicinae
```

### GNOME Startup Applications

An alternative to the systemd service is to use the GNOME Startup Applications in the [Tweaks](https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-tweaks) application which you can get from your software center. 

Just select the Vicinae application and GNOME should start the server automatically when a new session opens.

## Create keyboard shortcuts

### Toggle the window

To create a shortcut that toggles the Vicinae window on a specific keystroke, head to the GNOME keyboard settings and add a custom shortcut for the Vicinae application:

Once configured, you'll be able to toggle the Vicinae window whenever the shortcut is pressed, provided that the Vicinae server is running.

### Open a specific command

You can use [deeplinks](/deeplinks) to create a shortcut that directly opens a custom Vicinae command.

Just create a new shortcut that binds to e.g. `vicinae deeplink vicinae://extensions/vicinae/clipboard/history`.
